# best_hedge

Please refer to the attached historical data and propose a portfolio of 1 to 5
of the Eurostoxx 50 constituents which would best hedge a position of
long 1,000 shares of Pernod Ricard.

Please include the following:

1) how you are defining what is the best hedge

2) an explanation of your approach compared with alternative methods

3) your selected hedges along with the number of shares of each

The best_hedge.py file is the code I used to solve this problem. It requires the pandas, riskfolio, and matplotlib modules, which can be installed using the "-m pip install -r requirements.txt" command.

The source_data.xlsx file is the same that you provided me with in the email.

The Word answers.docx file is the file containing my answers.

In the correlation.csv file, you can see the correlations between stock returns using the pearson, spearman, and kendall methods.
